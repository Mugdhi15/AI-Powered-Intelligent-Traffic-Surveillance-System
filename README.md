# AI-Powered Intelligent Traffic Surveillance System

## 📌 Project Description  
A smart and automated traffic management system integrating **ANPR** (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) and **ATCC** (Automatic Traffic Classification & Control). It performs real-time vehicle detection, counting, classification, number plate extraction, violation detection, and intelligent traffic flow optimization. The system provides a **Flask-based dashboard** for live monitoring, video uploads, analytics, and database retrieval. Additional features include **helmet detection, triple-riding detection, accident detection, signal-jumping detection, heatmaps**, and **dynamic traffic-light switching**, enabling efficient law enforcement, surveillance, parking management, and urban planning.
